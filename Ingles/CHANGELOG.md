## 📝 Changelog

### [v3.1.4] - 2026-10-04
**Retro Pixel LED Lite: "Total Smoothness"**

#### ✨ Added
* **RetroBat Support:** automatically plays the GIF or retro marquee of the game you run in RetroBat.
* **Configurable SD Read Speed:** new `SD_SPEED` parameter (4, 10, 20, or 25 MHz) editable from the PWA (Hardware group), the OSD menu (Advanced Settings), and `config.ini`. Defaults to 10 MHz.
#### ⚙️ Improvements / Internal Changes
* **Two-Stage SD Boot:** the card first initializes at 4 MHz to read `config.ini` and then restarts at the configured speed. If the card fails to respond, it automatically falls back to a lower speed (25 → 20 → 10 → 4 MHz).
* **More Precise Inter-Frame Delay:** decoding and drawing time for each frame is now included within the GIF delay instead of being added to it, resulting in smoother playback.
* **New Partition Scheme (Minimal SPIFFS):** 1.9 MB for the app with OTA, compared to the previous 1.25 MB, giving more headroom for firmware growth.
* **New Language Key `sdspeed`:** added to the `SUBMENU_AVANZADO` section of language `.json` files for the new menu option.
#### 🛡️ Fixes
* **GIF Playback Speed:** fixed double frame delay (the library waited for the delay and the firmware waited for it again), which caused GIFs to play slower than their real-time rate.
#### ⚠️ Update Note
* Due to the partition scheme change, this version **cannot be updated via OTA** from previous versions: reinstall it using the web installer. Saved data in internal memory (active playlist and timer settings) will be wiped; settings and GIFs stored on the SD card are preserved. Also remember to update the `.json` language files.

---

### [v3.1.0] - 2026-08-02
**Retro Pixel LED Lite: "PWA Total Control"**

#### ✨ Added
* **Remote Control Progressive Web App (PWA):** installable web interface providing complete control of the panel from any device on the local network:
  - **Main Page:** real-time brightness and mode selector for GIF / Clock / Text, each displaying only relevant controls (playlist + random in GIF mode; style + color in Clock mode; live matrix preview + color + speed in Text mode).
  - **Timer:** power on/off schedule with immediate manual override from the app itself.
  - **Updater:** firmware OTA and language `.json` files downloader directly from GitHub into the SD card's `/idiomas` directory, without needing to remove the card.
  - **Settings:** remote editing of `config.ini` (WiFi, Hardware, Arcade, Scrolling Text, Clock, Weather, Language), with automatic reboot when required by changes.
* **Scrolling Text Mode with Custom Font Support:** scrolling text engine featuring a custom `GFXfont` (includes Polish characters) and a real-time UTF-8 decoder, togglable from the PWA with configurable color and speed.
* **Second Installation Mode for Batocera:** similar to Recalbox, you can now choose between "Menus and Games" (also reacts when browsing systems) or "Games Only" (fixed marquee/clock in menus, changes only upon launching a game).
* **Shutdown/Reboot Hooks for Batocera:** new scripts for EmulationStation's `quit`, `shutdown`, and `reboot` events, notifying the panel to exit the marquee upon exiting the system.
#### ⚙️ Improvements / Internal Changes
* **Web Routes Refactoring:** over 20 HTTP server endpoints extracted from `setup()` into a dedicated `WebRoutes.ino` file, organized by function (status, live control, timer, config, playlists, OTA, languages, arcade, text).
* **Rebootless Live Control:** brightness, playback mode, random toggle, clock style, and color are now instantly applied from the PWA and saved to `config.ini` without requiring a panel reboot.
* **Revamped Power-Off Animation:** replaced the sleeping face with a CRT screen power-off style animation, while halving the transition's blocking time.
* **Image Quality in Marquee Tools:** Floyd-Steinberg dithering to RGB565 and high-quality rendering ported to Logos and Batocera converters to eliminate color banding in gradients when displayed on the panel.
* **Reorganized Arcade Scripts Installer:** Batocera and Recalbox scripts are now distributed in separate `Batocera/` and `Recalbox/` subfolders instead of being mixed in a single folder.
#### 🛡️ Fixes
* **Brightness Adjustment Cycle:** fixed logic bug in the brightness loop that prevented resetting to 5% after reaching 100%.
* **Timer and Web Server:** fixed an issue where the panel stopped responding to HTTP requests while sleeping, preventing remote power-on from the PWA.

### [v3.0.5] - 2026-06-18

#### 🛡️ Fixes
* **Rainbow Effect Stability:** fixed rendering of the dynamic *Rainbow* effect, which was negatively affected by clock anti-flicker optimization when *Double Buffer* was disabled.
* **OSD Brightness Refresh:** fixed visual glitch in the OSD menu; brightness percentage now updates dynamically on-screen in real time while adjusting via remote or button.

#### 🛡️ Fixes
- **Rendering Stability:** eliminated memory allocation errors (*StoreProhibited*) under high network load conditions.
- **Log Cleanup:** improved system initialization diagnostics to detect buffer allocation failures early.

### [v1.1.0] - 2026-03-03
**Retro Pixel LED Lite: "The Weather & Notification Update"**

#### ✨ Added
